Project: Donate My Data (DmD)
Purpose: The purpose of these utilities is to test the functionally of a system that has been configured to run the DmD project codebase 

The DmD Test Utilities are broken into X tools.
DmD RAW XML Generator, DmD Acquirer, DmD Importer, DmD Obfuscator, and DmD Exporter

DmD RAW XML Generator - 


dmd importer
To test the functionality of dmd importer first generate test xml files but doing this:

cd /opt/dmd/test/
perl generate-xml-files.pl

test files are generated in the /opt/dmd/test/import directory

verify that the files were generated by executing the following command:

ls import

Next import the xml test files into mark logic database.

The presumes that marklogic is installed with a test database having an xdbc server attached that is listening on port 8776.  Adjust the dmd-import.pl script as needed with username, password, host and correct port.  

execute the dmd-import.pl script as follows:

perl dmd-import.pl

Verify that the files were injested by using MarkLogic Query Console with the content source set to the dmd-alpha database and click 'Explore'.

dmd exporter

To test export type the following command:

perl dmd-export.pl

there will be a zip file generated into exportdir.  The script will fail if the exportdir already exists.
