Picked up pt shortly after trach was performed at the bedside and found site to be bleeding a lot. I changed the trach sponges for saturated with blood three times in the first 90 minutes and called the team to evaluate pt. Stat clot to BB was sent as well as stat crit. Pt had bronchoscopy to evaluate the bleeding and medical team ended up calling surgery. The bleeding was not able to be put under control despite pt getting two doses of DDAVP and suturing at the site. The decision was maed to take out the trach and try to control the bleeding. He was reintubated orally and the trach was taken out after which he proceeded to bleed more quickly. Pt was sent to the OR for emergent trach exploration and closure. He is due back any moment.

Neuro: Pt awake and alert. Sometimes speech is difficult to understand. Today was talking about making a phone call but it was difficult due to his poor speech. Pt wanted to get up OOB but did not due to the PEG placement procedure. He is very stiff, requires full lift and assist with all ADL's. 
 
Cardiac: One dose of diltiazem held today due to HR in the 50's. BP stable 120-140. Pt was given a dose of 20mg IV lasix today. Has had good effect.

GI: Had a J-tube inserted in radiology today and tolerated this well. We can use it for meds and give him his tube feeds at half the normal goal rate until tomorrow afternoon when we can increase it back to the goal rate. Currently on promote w/fiber at 30cc/hr. The site is draining moderate to lrge amts serous drainage and the dressing was changed by myself twice. I caled the radiologist who inserted the tube and she feels as long as the bleeding is not grossly bloody and just clear to serous that it is probably due to his generalized body edema and may drain for a while. I have the Gastric port hooked up to gravity drainage and the j-port has the tube feeds. Gastric drainage is golden/yellow clear bile. Pt stooled three times today, green loose. 
 
GU: Foley draining drk urine at first but now clear yellow since he got the lasix. I did run the irrigant for a while but have it off now trying to get an accurate I+O.

CV: Another swan was placed, again unable to wedge, PAP pressures very high into the 90s, sometimes high than her ABP. She was having episodes of hypotension which responded to an increase in her neo. At 3 am she dropped her BP to the 30s, HR to the 50s, she was given 1 mg IV epi, neo wide open, IVF wide open, levo. She quicly responded with a HR into the 180s - wide complex, BP into the 180s. Her complex did not stay wide for very long but she cont to have a low BP, high HR, she was desating into the 80s, low 90s. Cardioverted at 150J without effect. Swan was d/ced in case it was causing the the high HR. FI02 increaed to 100%, PEEP to 10, CXR showed CHF - she was given 80mg of IV lasix - with poor u/o of 45cc after 2 hrs. She was given dilt 10mg x2 with initial good effect but it did not last for very long. She was put on a dilt gtt with little effect. Cardiology ws called, they came in and did an echo which did not show an effusion. Their recommendation was to start amnio.

CV: Conts to require lg amounts and varieties of pressors. Pt's SBP had been in the 80s but it started to drop. She was acidotic and was given lots of bicarb amps which did seem to help increase her BP. She was started on milrinone, dopa was added, she cont to have a SBP 60-70, the milronone was d/ced, dopa stopped, amnio was stopped. Slowly during the rest of the night her SBP started to rise, she was at 90 for a brief period of time, HR has been 1 teens to 120s. After turning her she dropped her BP to the 60s and at present does not seem to be moving from there. The hep conts. Swan #s little change, SVR 600s, CO by fick 6.6 
 
Pulm: LS coarse, sx for mod amount of cream colored sputum. She remains fully vented, her VTs were increased to try and improve her pH. She conts to overbreath the vent but not as much as she was on the lower tidal volume.

NPN/DEATH NOTE 
 
Pt was having high peak pressures to the 50s and plateaus to the 50s as well, her wedge was 20 (she was receiving wide open fluid and bicarb gtt). IVIG was started but was stopped because we needed the port to give other meds. Her ABD was very taught - per the resident - surgery said that they did not have anything to offer her since she was in DIC and would not be a surgical candidate. The fluid was stopped, she soon started to drop her BP. Pt started to drop her SBP to the 70s, her pH cont to be low. She was given 3 amps of bicarb with an initial good responce but very soon she would again drop her BP. Dopa was started but this increased her HR to the 140s and was soon changed to neo. Pt cont to require additional syringes of bicarb, she was started on a bicarb gtt. Her husband was called and told of the gravity of the situation and he came in. It was decided that the main objective was to keep her comfortable, he soon decided to withdraw care, her BP dropped quickly and then her HR - pt was pronounced by the resident.

Review of Systems: 
 
Resp: Stressful day for pt; decreased sedation overnight led to agitated state , pt. fighting vent causing autopeep. Initially settled out on increased sedation, and brought down for Chest CT which revealed new 50% R pneumothorax. At 12 pm, pt acutely desaturated from 90's-80%. Pt. respositioned, suctioned, and resp. contacted for vent. settings adjustments. Continued to desat., team notified and in to see pt. fio2 eventually increased to 100% without effect. CT surgery consulted. Unable to immediately place new CT due to Heparin drip (needed gtt off x 2-3 hrs), drip dc'd and pt paralyzed w/ Doxacurium drip @ 10 cc/hr to decrease 02 requirements. Despite these interventions, abg as such: 55/90/7.26/42. At 1400 anterior CT (24 French, 16 cm) placed to 20 cm of wall suction. o2 sats immediately increased to 90's on 100% fio2. For procedure, pt sedated w/ 7cc Propofol, Ativan titrated to 6 mg/hr and MSO4 titrated to 8mg/hr. CT has positive fluctuation and air leak and crepitus, drainage is sanguinous. Dsg D and I. X-ray confirmed correct placement. crepitus around site is from previous Chest tubes. Vent settings currently @ 600X16, FIO2 90%, Peep 4.8, Sat's 90%, not overbreathing while on paralytic. LS currently clear bilaterally, diminished in bases. Trach care done, site benign. Suctioned thin and white. Family notified by intern as to pt's decline in status. ONly able to reach [**Male First Name (un) **].. when family returns call, will need to speak with intern.

NPN 7AM-11PM: 
S/O: Pt has had a very eventful day. At~6:45 AM he was noted to have SBP 40's by NBP, with HR 60's. Initially responsive, but rapidly decreasing responsiveness followed by respiratory arrest. Pt was ambued with 100% FiO2, then intubated. An A-line was placed; we have consistently been able to easily draw blood from the line, but it appears dampened and reads quite a bit lower than the NBP, so we have been using the NBP all day. He soon required pressors for SBP 70's. He was started initially on Neo, which was titrated up to a max of 120 mcg/min with little if any effect. he was then started on Levo. Over several hours, with some difficulty, the Neo was weaned to off with the Levo as high as 40 mcg/min. He was transiently on Dopa, as high as 10 mcg/kg/min, but it was soon D/C'd d/t HR into the 140's. Around 1PM his BP again began to fall, into the 50's. His extremities were cold, and HR dropped into the 60's again. He was given 250cc fluid bolus, and Dopa was again attempted, at a lower dose. This time, however, he began to have lots of ventricular ectopy, including short runs of VT. Dopa was again D/C'd, Levo increased more, and he again stabilized for a few hours. About 7:45 he suddenly went into sustained VT. A-line tracing was flat (though is has never been reliable). In the interest of saving time, a cuff pressure was not checked. He was unresponsive, and was defibrillated once with 200J. He converted initially to ST with lots of ectopy, then settled down into NSR after a few minutes. 
He has remained in NSR since. BP is borderline on high-dose Levo. 
EKG shows ST depressions, but not much changed from yesterday. CK's, Troponin added to earlier labs.

NPN 7A-7P: 
NEURO/COMFORT: Pt started day on Fentanyl gtt at 100mcg/hr. She was lethargic, but with several attempts would follow commands. She consistently refused to open her eyes, and actively resisted when I attempted to open them. She was inconsistent in her response when asked if she was having pain; at times she nodded, at times she shook her head, at times she did not answer. Over the day, her Fentanyl was decreased to 40mcg/hr. She has awakened very gradually over the day. She now opens eyes to command, generally follows commands, moves all extremities, though weakly and only with encouragement. She will answer questions; initially she was confused, but has cleared somewhat. 
RESP: Pt remained on [**01-30**], 40% till 4PM, when she was extubated to 50% FT. Post-extubation she is quite wheezy and rhonchorous (new).

P-MICU NURSING ADMISSION NOTE: PT IS A 55 Y/O WF W/ PMHX OF HTN AND HYPOTHYROIDISM WHO WAS DX'D W/ BILATERAL BREAST CA LAST YEAR (+ LYMPH NODES BILATERALLY BUT NO DISTANT METS.) SHE THEN UNDERWENT BILATERAL MASTECTOMIES FOLLOWED BY 4 CYCLES OF CYTOXAN/ADRIAMYCIN. THE PT DEVELOPED SOB AFTER HER LAST CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DX'D W/ BIVENTRICULAR CHF (LVEF < 25 % W/ SEVERE MR), WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE SECONDARY TO ADRIAMYCIN. SHE HAD BEEN MANAGED AS AN OUTPATIENT BY THE CHF TEAM AT [**Hospital1 2**], BUT DEVELOPED MENTAL STATUS CHANGES, SLURRED SPEECH, WEAKNESS, AND WORSENING CARDIAC AND RENAL FUNCTION [**07-28**] WHICH PROMPTED ADMISSION (HEAD CT NORMAL.) SHORTLY AFTER ADMISSION, PT TRANSFERRED TO CCU D/T HYPOTENSION. SHE WAS LATER INTUBATED AND REMAINED IN CCU FOR RX OF SEPSIS/CHF/ARRYTHMIA/RENAL FAILURE UNTIL [**08-14**]. AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS ON MEDICINE, PT AGAIN BECAME ACUTELY SOB AND TRANSFERRED TO [**Wardname 319**] TO BE REINTUBATED. 
 ASSESSMENT: PT IS INTUBATED. CURRENT VENT SETTINGS: A/C 12X450X40%. ABG: 97/38/7.49/30/5. BS'S ARE CLEAR THROUGHOUT. SX'D FOR VERY FEW SECRETIONS. PT IS ALLERGIC TO MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 320**] SO SHE IS SEDATED W/ FENTYNL DRIP AT 25 MCGS/HR. THE PT IS WELL SEDATED, BUT EASY TO AROUSE AND INTERACTIVE (HER MENTAL STATUS HAS REPORTEDLY IMPROVED SINCE ADMISSION). NITRO DRIP HAS BEEN WEANED TO OFF. FIRST CK'S ARE FLAT. HR'S HAVE BEEN IN 60'S W/O ECTOPY. SBP'S HAVE BEEN VERY STABLE. UO HAS PICKED UP TO 60- 125 CC'/HR ON LASIX DRIP AT 12 MG'S/HR. SHE IS QUITE ANASARCIC. LINES: PICC PLACED IN R AC [**08-14**], ART LINE PLACED IN R RAD ART LAST NIGHT. NGT ALSO PLACED ON L NARE. SHE HAS MULTIPLE SKIN ISSUES. FIRST SHE IS ALLERGIC TO TAPE AND HAS SCABS ALL OVER HER FACE FROM LAST INTUBATION. CURRENT ETT SECURED WITH A VELCRO STRAP. FINGER AND TOE TIPS ARE NECROTIC, ALTHOUGH SHE HAS GOOD BILATERAL RADIAL AND PEDAL PULSES. VASCULAR HAS SEEN HER AND THINKS THIS MAY BE R/T LEVO THAT SHE WAS ON IN CCU, BUT CAN'T R/O SEPTIC EMBOLI SINCE SHE ALSO HAD A-FIB IN CCU. SHE ALSO HAS SILVER DOLLAR SIZE ESCHARS ON EACH OF HER FOREARMS THAT I THINK ALSO LOOK LIKE THEY ARE D/T SEPTIC EMBOLI, BUT DERM DOES NOT AGREE W/ ME. IN ADDITION, ONE OF HER HEELS IS STARTING TO BREAK DOWN SO I OUT MULTIPODUS BOOTS ON HER. SHE HAS ALSO BEEN HAVING DIARRHEA (C-DIFF NEG) AND HER BUT IS RAW W/ A FEW AREAS OF VERY SUPERFICIAL BREAKDOWN. "BUTT BAG" APPLIED BUT HAS HAD NO FURTHER DIARRHEA TONIGHT. 
 SOCIALLY, PT IS MARRIED AND HAS THREE CHILDREN. HER SISTER HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE FAMILY ROOM. ALL ARE VERY INVOLVED IN HER CARE. HUSBAND IS HOPING THAT HER CARDIOMYOPATHY WILL IMPROVE (APPARENTLY THIS CAN HAPPEN W/IN ONE YEAR OF THE LAST DOSE OF ADRIAMYCIN, IN THIS CASE [**1995-11-26**].) THERE IS SOME DOCUMENTATION IN THE RECORD, HOWEVER, THAT THE PT DID NOT WANT TO BE REINTUBATED. MICU ATTENDING IS HOPING THAT SHE WILL QUICKLY WEAN FROM THE VENT. IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, A FAMILY MEETING INCLUDING THE PT IS IN ORDER TO CLARIFY WHAT HER WISHES ARE.

MICU NPN/TX NOTE: 
 SICU team has spoken extensively with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 346**] [**Last Name (un) 347**] (pts closest living/competent blood relative per social work) via telephone. The nature of pts stroke and prognosis for a meaningful recovery were explained in depth to [**Last Name (un) 346**] by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 348**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 349**], Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 350**] (attending), and myself. At this time, [**Name (STitle) 346**] wishes to make pt DNR/DNI and remove pt from respirator. This was offerred in accordance with his wishes to "let nature take its course." [**Name (STitle) 346**] verbalizes his understanding that these decisions will most likely result in the patients death. At this time [**Name (STitle) 346**] does not wish to visit the hospital. 
 Pt has been made a DNR/DNI per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 350**]. The propofol was d/c'd and pt was extubated to 40 % CSM per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 350**].

SOCIAL WORK NOTE: 
Received RNCM referral to talk with pt's daughter, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 352**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 353**], to offer support during pt's hospitalization. Pt is an 83 yo widowed woman who lives alone in elderly housing at [**Street Address 354**]. in [**Location (un) 355**]. Pt's dtr is her only child. Her other dtr died at the age of 22. [**Doctor First Name 352**] reports that pt has acquired an electric wheelchair over the past six months (but has difficulty driving it) and has HHA services one time per week. If necessary, pt's dtr is hopeful that pt could have rehabilitation services at [**Hospital 243**] Rehab. Will notify RNCM of this preference. 
 Met with dtr privately to offer support. Pt is intubated at this time. Dtr has four sons and a niece but feels that the decisions re: pt's care fall on her and she seeks support from her husband for this. She is having some difficulty thinking through what would constitute quality of life for pt going forward from here but wants pt to have a chance to stabilize and get better if possible. She is open to the idea of DNR at this time but upon further discussion with RN and MD after this meeting, this decision was postponed until tomorrow. Dtr is clearly thoughtful about such decisions and seemed to benefit from opportunity to talk. Will remain involved as needed to offer continued support to daughter during this difficult time.

MICU PROGRESS NURSING NOTE: 
 
Patient admitted to hospital on [**03-28**] from osh for treatment of left carotid psuedoaneurysm. He had originally presented to the osh for left ear bleed,epistaxis. Angiography had demonstrated a left ICA psuedoaneurysn/dissection. MRA showed no flow to R ICA, also R mastoiditis, and a left ear lesion. Patient underwent repair of pseudoaneurysm on [**03-29**], with double stent placement. He returned to OR on [**04-04**] for coiling of aneurysm with stent placement. The patient has had episodes of SVT during his stay. He has additional history of recent anemia secondary to his epistaxis, as well as syncope. Hx also includes HTN, COPD, Etoh use ( 3 drinks/day), gout, basal cell CA, ? TIAs. 
Received patient at 11pm shortly after his arrival from surgery. Alert and oriented times 3 although somewhat confused about his foley cath, asking several times to use the urinal or get up to go to the bathroom. Moves all extremities well. Right leg with brace. Doppler pulses feet and right groin. He has been lying flat since arrival although he has been logrolled side to side x 3. Placed on NEO shortly after arrival for blood pressures high 

80s to low 100s. Target BP was 140-160 since modified to 130-170. Patient required a good amount of titrating since his pressures were very labile. He did have an episode of very low blood pressure, 50s systolic after being turned although he did not lose consciousness. He did have slurred speech and c/o pain in right arm. He was given a 500cc fluid bolus and NEO was increased to 10mics. He was noted to be in an SVT of 140s at that time. He did stabilize after a short while and was able to answer questions appropriately. Pupils equal and briskly reactive. The neo gtt was titrated back to pre-incident levels although it did need to be periodically increased in small increments for transient drops in pressure. HR returned to NSR, 70s-80s. He was noted to have PVCs, PACS, for a brief period after SVT broke. Placed on Heparin gtt at 600 units at 0230. Due for PTT at 0830. Magnesium replaced during the night. His right groin dressing with sanguinous drainage that has increased during the night and is now leaking out somewhat. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 668**] notified as NSicu does not want dressing touched. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 668**] did look at dressing and did not feel there was a worrisome amount of bleeding and preferred to wait for Nsicu team to see it. 
 
Resp: Face tent changed to NC 6L, decreased to 4L this am. Sats high 90s to 100%. Lung sounds coarse posterior all fields, clear anteriorly. Good cough effort. Bringing up clear sputum which is being Yankaur suctioned.
