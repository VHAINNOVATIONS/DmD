This distribution is a subportion of the MITRE Annotation Toolkit
(MAT). In this distribution, you'll find a standalone viewer for
documents. This viewer is documented in
web/htdocs/doc/html/standalone_viewer.html. The documents make
extensive use of the MAT-JSON format (which you'll find described in
detail in web/htdocs/doc/html/mat_json_format.html). This viewer
allows you to view single or multiple documents with CSS
formatting which you can specify. A working example can be found in
web/examples/standalone_viewer_example.html.
